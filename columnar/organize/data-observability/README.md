# Data Observability

### **Data Observability**

The goal of data observability to provide data teams immediate visibility, detection of data issues, and impact analysis. We recommend using Elementary Data for data observability- they are open source, integrate with DBT, and will help resolve data errors quickly.

Data observability tooling allows for continuous monitoring of data quality metrics, freshness, volume and schema changes, including anomaly detection. Elementary Data collects dbt artifacts, runs and test results as part of your runs. It monitor the operations of your data stack, and centralizes metadata easily.
