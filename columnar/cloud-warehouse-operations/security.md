# Security

### Encryption

Encryption-in-transit and encryption-at-rest are important security measures that can help protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized parties. They help prevent data breaches and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information by using a cryptographic algorithm with secret key to encode the data. The key is used to encrypt the data before it is transmitted or stored, and used to decrypt the data when it is received or accessed. This ensures that only authorized parties who have access to the key can read the encrypted data.

#### Encryption-in-transit

Encryption-in-transit refers to the process of encrypting data while it is being transmitted from one location to another. This is typically used to protect sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.

#### Encryption-at-rest

Encryption-at-rest refers to the process of encrypting data while it is stored on a device, such as a hard drive or a server. This can provide an additional layer of security for sensitive data, ensuring that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties even if the device is physically stolen or accessed without permission.
