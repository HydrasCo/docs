# Scaling compute and disk storage

## Upgrading storage

Hydra can scale your storage up to 16 TB. Depending on your columnar compression ratio, this
typically allows you to store 100-200 TB of data.

You can monitor your current disk usage from the Hydra dashboard. Click on your data
warehouse, then view the graph labelled "Disk Available." It's best to keep at least 20 GB
of available space at all times as Postgres does write temporary results to disk when
performing large computations.

To increase your storage, please contact us via support. We can add storage without any downtime.
Please note that there is a 6-hour cooldown time between storage increases.
