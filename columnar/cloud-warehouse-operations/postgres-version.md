# Postgres version

Hydra supports Postgres 13 and 14. Newly created Hydra data warehouses use Postgres 14. For the current release in use on your data warehouse, please run `SELECT VERSION()`. Hydra updates databases to their latest minor (14.x and 13.x) point releases when other updates are rolled out. For details, please see [our documentation on maintenance](maintenance.md).

## Major Version Upgrades

Major version upgrades will be coordinated with you. A brief downtime window is required. If you are currently running Postgres 13 and would like to upgrade to Postgres 14, please contact support.
