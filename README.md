Hydra is an open source data warehouse built on Postgres. Hydra leverages columnar storage, vectorized execution, and query parallelization to efficiently serve online analytical processing of queries (OLAP). Unlike traditional warehouses, Hydra supports Postgres heap tables, indexing, and native partitioning to process high-throughput transactional writes, quick lookup and operational queries, and hybrid transactional / analytics processing workloads (HTAP).

Hydra is offered as a fully-managed cloud warehouse and as self-hosted open source software. We offer a [free instance](https://dashboard.hydra.so/signup) of Hydra's cloud warehouse as well as free [open source](https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra).&#x20;
