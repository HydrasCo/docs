Hydra (🐘🤘) is open source, column-oriented Postgres. You can query billions of rows instantly on Postgres without code changes. Parallelized analytics in minutes, not weeks.

## Getting Started

Try the [Hydra Free Tier](https://dashboard.hydra.so/signup) to create a column-oriented Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc).

Alternatively, you can run Hydra locally.
